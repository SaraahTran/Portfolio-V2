<h2>Overview</h2>

The Basta Group is a luxurious real estate business. I was approached by the client to initially design and develop concepts for their brand. They wanted something professional that was clean and minimalistic.

<h3>Brand Identity</h3>

I was assigned to help create a brand identity for The Basta Group from scratch. They wanted the theme of their brand to appear luxurious, modern, high end and sleek, and have the colour scheme of white, black, red and gold.

<h3>Logo</h3>

The logo is one of the most important parts to developing a strong brand identity so that was what we started with. 

<br><br>I asked questions about what the client wanted on the logo. He wanted the initials 'TBG' and possibly hexagons, if they fit.

As it is a real estate company, I thought it would also be a good idea to incorporate a house. 

I proceeded to sketch out numerous ideas. 

<div class="image">
<img class="big-half" src=src/tbg-sketch.png>
</div>

Generally, the client liked all the concepts but was learning more towards #3 as they wanted something minimalistic. The logo depicts a house shaped in a hexagon with the initials 'TBG' underneath. After further discussion, I moved the concept onto Adobe Illustrator. 

We finalised on this version of the logo:

<div class="image">
<img class="big-half" src=src/the-basta-group-logo.png>
</div>

<h3>Business Card</h3>

The client also asked me to design a business card. Using the same colour scheme and brand elements, I worked with the client to create a business card, updating him constantly with different versions until he was satisfied. Eventually, we settled on this:

<div class="image">
<img class="full" src=src/tbg-businesscard.png>
</div>

<br>

<h3>Website</h3>

For the website, I used Wordpress as it is a very powerful CMS platform and also very easy for the client to edit.

This was the design I came up with: 


<div class="image">
<img class="full" src=src/the-basta-group-website.png>
</div>

<br>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

This is one of my freelance projects and I really enjoyed working on this with the client. It was very enjoyable for me to help create a brand identity from scratch and to develop it more over a course of different projects such as the logo, business card and website. I learned how to remain consistent with the brand image and to always ask for feedback to ensure we are on the same page.
