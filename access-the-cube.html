<h2>Overview</h2>

Access the Cube is a marketing company that helps clients create and implement successful marketing strategies.

<h3>Brand Identity</h3>

Access the Cube reached out to me with the intention, to ask me to help them with coming up with an identity for their business. They particularly wanted geometric shapes to be included into the design and they also were open to any colour choices.

<h3>Logo</h3>

When we were discussing about the logo, they told me that they told what elements were important. They particularly wanted a cube with an eye and maybe a star.

<br><br>I showed them several sketches and it took them a some time before they told me which one they liked the best.

<h3>Website</h3>

For the website, I used Wordpress as it is easy for them to edit and make changes. They wanted the style of the website to be fun, animated and playful. They specified that they wanted the animations to be related to cubes and/or geometric shapes.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

I really enjoyed working on this project with the client. I wanted to make sure that the brand identity was expressed the way they wanted it to be and I believe it was a success.
